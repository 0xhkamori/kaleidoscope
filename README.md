# Implementing new modules
#### Step 1: Create a New Module File
1. Create a new ```.py``` file in the modules folder. For example, name it ```modulename.py```.

2. Add the necessary imports to your module file. For example, if you need a timer function, you would add:

```python
import time
```

3. Add commands list:

```python
commands = ['command', 'command2'] #add more if needed
```

4. Define the main function of your module:

```python
async def handle(app: Client, client: Client, message, args):
```

5. Write your code inside this function. For example, if you want to send a message using Pyrogram, use the following:

```python
await app.send_message(message.chat.id, "Your message here")
```

6. Working with Pyrogram: To create useful modules, it's important to know how to work with Pyrogramâ€™s methods. Refer to the Pyrogram documentation if needed.

#### Step 2: Using Configuration Options
If your module requires reading or writing to a configuration file, import the configuration functions like this:

```python
from utils import config
```

You can then use the following functions:

- ```config.add_to_config(key, value)``` â€“ Add or update a key-value pair.
- ```config.read_from_config(key)``` â€“ Read a specific key from the config.
- ```config.read_all_keys()``` â€“ Get all configuration keys.
- ```remove_from_config(key)``` â€“ Remove key-value pair.

#### Final Notes
- Testing: Once youâ€™ve added the command, test your module by running the bot and executing the command in a chat.
- Expanding: You can continue adding more functionality to your module as needed by using Pyrogramâ€™s extensive methods and utilities.
By following these steps, you will be able to create and integrate custom modules into your userbot.
