# Implementing new modules
#### Step 1: Create a New Module File
1. Create a new ```.py``` file in the modules folder. For example, name it ```modulename.py```.

2. Add the necessary imports to your module file. For example, if you need a timer function, you would add:

```python
import time
```

3. Define the main function of your module. If your module does not require any arguments, the function signature should be:

```python
async def handle(app: Client, client: Client, message):
```

If your command requires arguments, modify the function like this:

```python
async def handle(app: Client, client: Client, message, args):
```

4. Write your code inside this function. For example, if you want to send a message using Pyrogram, use the following:

```python
await app.send_message(message.chat.id, "Your message here")
```

5. Working with Pyrogram: To create useful modules, it's important to know how to work with Pyrogramâ€™s methods. Refer to the Pyrogram documentation if needed.

#### Step 2: Using Configuration Options
If your module requires reading or writing to a configuration file, import the configuration functions like this:

```python
from utils import config
```

You can then use the following functions:

- ```config.add_to_config(key, value)``` â€“ Add or update a key-value pair.
- ```config.read_from_config(key)``` â€“ Read a specific key from the config.
- ```config.read_all_keys()``` â€“ Get all configuration keys.

#### Step 3: Modify ```message_handler.py```
Open the ```message_handler.py``` file located in the ```utils``` folder.

Add your module to the import statement. You will find a line like this:

```python
from modules import ping, help, info, stop, exec, translate, setprefix, restart, ily, moonlove, weather, settings
```
You need to add your module name (without the ```.py``` extension) to the list. For example, if your module is named ```modulename.py```, the line should look like this:

```python
from modules import ping, help, info, stop, exec, translate, setprefix, restart, ily, moonlove, weather, settings, modulename
```

Add your command handling logic. Find the section where commands are handled and add a new block for your command. For example:

```python
elif command == 'yourcommand':
    await app.delete_messages(message.chat.id, message.id)
    await modulename.handle(app, client, message, args)  # Remove args if not needed
```

#### Step 4: Add Your Command to the Help Menu
To list your command in the help section, update the ```msgtosend``` variable in ```help.py``` by adding your new command to the list of available commands. For example:

```python
f"{e} **ILoveYou:**  (`ily`)\n"
f"{e} **Weather:**  (`weather`)"
f"{e} **YourModuleName:** (`yourmodulecommand`)")
```

#### Final Notes
- Testing: Once youâ€™ve added the command, test your module by running the bot and executing the command in a chat.
- Expanding: You can continue adding more functionality to your module as needed by using Pyrogramâ€™s extensive methods and utilities.
By following these steps, you will be able to create and integrate custom modules into your userbot.
